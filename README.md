# End-to-End RAG Application for FX Regulations
This repository hosts an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to answer questions related to foreign exchange (FX) regulations. 
The document retrieval process leverages both lexical search and semantic search techniques, using TF-IDF and Gemini embeddings to accurately score and retrieve relevant documents.
It is integrated with various APIs including Cohere for reranking documents, Google Gemini for response generation, and Google Drive for feedback store.
